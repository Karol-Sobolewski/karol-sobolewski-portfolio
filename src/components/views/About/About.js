      Since I finished secondary school I have been interested in programming,
      but I went different way and I have became an archaeologist.

      I like history, especially Olmec archaeology. Olmec culture was earliest
      Mesoamerican civilization that was spread across Gulf of Mexico and other
      regions of Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras from 1700 till 400 BC.

    <p>
      I spend my free time on watching films and TV series. I also like reading
      fantasy, crime fiction and historical books. Besides that I love to play
      video games including: Civilization 6, Heroes of Might & Magic III,
      Crusader Kings II, Ancestors Legacy, Hell Let Loose, Red Dead Redemption 2
      and NBA 2K.

    <p>
      Recently I have became fit enthusiast. I lost around 30kg by running and
      keeping with the diet. In future I would like to keep this progress and
      build some muscles.

    <p>Travel to as many countries as I can is my goal.</p>
